Installation
============

This document describes how to install the CERT Australia CTI Toolkit.

Installation is streamlined using Python's setuptools. The following
installation process has been tested on clean install of Ubuntu 14.04.

#. Install prerequisites required by setuptools and libtaxii::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libz-dev

#. Install the cti-toolkit::

    $ sudo pip install cti-toolkit

That's it. You should now be able to run utilities, such as
``stixtransclient.py``::

    $ stixtransclient.py -h


Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is available at `<http://cti-toolkit.readthedocs.org/>`_.

To build the documentation you need Sphinx::

    $ sudo pip install Sphinx sphinxcontrib-napoleon sphinx_rtd_theme
    $ cd docs
    $ make html

This will create an HTML version of the documentation in ``docs/_build/html``.

Tests
-----

Requires tox::

    $ sudo pip install tox

Then run the tests from the repository root using::

    $ tox
